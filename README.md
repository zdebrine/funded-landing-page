# Landing page for SpotSense.io

## How to get started:

1. Navigate to folder in terminal
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `gulp`

Gulp will create a webserver and open your browser to the URL of the site (usually localhost:3000)

Your browser will autorefresh whenever you make any changes!

## Important!!
Make sure you don't work on the master branch--create a branch with a title for what you're working on

Good Examples:
* analytics-demo
* segment-tracking

Bad Examples:
* just using your name
* using random strings of words
